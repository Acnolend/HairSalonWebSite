# HairSalonWebSite

A website for a hair salon, it was design in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It's a college project, the idea of the project was chosen by us, it wasn't force by the professor. We've used different IDEs such as Visual Studio Code and WebStorm. Keep in mind that if you like run the project in VS code you should install an extension called "Live Server". After that you must right click on the .html file you want to run and click on "Run with Live Server".
